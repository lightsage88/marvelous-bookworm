# Marvelous Bookworm

A web-application that allows users to create collections of their favorite Marvel Comics characters. Lists will present information in cards that give information about the character, if available, and a collection of links for the character's series that allow the user to potentially buy them.

## Motivation

I like comic books and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I thought a tool that would help people see where certain characters came from and how they've developed would be useful for newcomers to these characters and comic-lovers alike.
