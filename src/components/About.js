                <p>Comic book characters frequently have spin-off series or collections of stories that focus on a particular
                version of that character. Some of them taking place on parallel worlds or universes. Some go on for quite a while.

                the mantle of Spider-Man or Captain America, for example, you'll enjoy how easily this app can make you aware of how to
